## Php-MySQL-Connector

This repository contains a PHP script for connecting to a MySQL database and performing basic operations.

### Installation

1. Ensure you have XAMPP installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository and extract it to your local machine.
3. Copy the `Php-MySQL-Connector` folder to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. The `htdocs` directory is typically located in the XAMPP installation directory.
4. Make sure XAMPP is turned on and Apache and MySQL services are running.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port>/Php-MySQL-Connector/` to verify that the PHP scripts are accessible. Replace `<port>` with the port number configured for Apache in your XAMPP settings.

### Configuration

Before using the PHP scripts, ensure that your MySQL database is configured correctly and that the credentials in the `connect.php` file match your database configuration.

1. Open the `connect.php` file located in the `Php-MySQL-Connector` folder.
2. Update the database host, username, password, and database name as per your MySQL configuration.
3. Save the changes.

### Usage

Once the PHP scripts are set up and configured:

- You can use the provided PHP scripts to interact with your MySQL database.
- Make sure to properly sanitize and validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- Refer to the documentation in each PHP file for usage instructions and examples.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check that XAMPP is running and that the port number specified in the URL matches the one configured for Apache.
- Verify that the database credentials in the `connect.php` file are correct.
- Check the XAMPP logs for any error messages or warnings.
